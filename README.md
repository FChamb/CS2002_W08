# CS2002 W08 Practical - Architecture and Stackframes in C

# Introduction:
### This project directory consists of a commented architecture factorial file and a specification accurate StackFrame.c file. The commented assembly file breaks down the factorial function line-by-line into user readable content. The StackFrame file contains logic to print out the stack frame data for the factorial function in the practical specification format.

# Instructions:
1. Open terminal and cd into src of project directory
2. Run the command: 'make clean'
3. Run the command: 'make'
4. Run the command: './TryStackFrames'
